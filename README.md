# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, along with JavaScript by incorporating them all together in this project. I built this project to learn the basics of Github and the crucial relationship between local and remote repositories. It, again, also taught me the basics of the front-end programming languages that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to provide a concise and effective study guide for students learning to review the basics of the three front-end languages mentioned. It does so through an easy to understand webpage that is also visually appealing. I learned that the relationship between the local and remote repositories is a bit complex, but it is awesome and innovative in the way that it allows multiple collaborators to work together on the same repository at once. I also learned that debugging is an essential, although tiresome, task that cannot be treated haphazardly. The goal of producing an MVP is long, but worth it.
